- 👋 Hi, I’m @lancsSteve
- 👀 I’m interested in CAQDAS Software (primarily NVivo and ATLAS.ti, also MAXQDA, QUIRKOS etc) and methods to integrate other fat sources into these packages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various research methods and how to translate into software guidance and methods implementations.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the above (I'm not a coder but ama tester, writer and trainer)
- 📫 How to reach me message here I guess.
